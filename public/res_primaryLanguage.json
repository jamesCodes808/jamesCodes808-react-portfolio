    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm James Ian Ragasa Solima, an application developer that likes all things nerdy! I am an Army veteran with a Bachelorâ€™s Of Science in Information Technology, where I was exposed to different subjects of IT, databases and development. I have always been fascinated with tech and have been chasing that fascination since I left the Army. I have since learned front-end languages and frameworks such as HTML5, CSS3, ES6 Javascript, React, and Bootstrap. Some of the back-end languages that I have experience with are ASP.NET, C#, and MySQL. With this knowledge I helped build a working MVP for a start-up called HubLink in 3 months and worked on an L2 App Prod Support team for Bank Of America for the past 2 years. I am currently focused on learning the MERN stack and Python with Code Fellows. With my background I am able to stay resourceful, adaptable and persistent with learning new technologies and concepts to contribute innovation to any team I am a part of. Thanks for stopping by, hope to hear from you soon!",
